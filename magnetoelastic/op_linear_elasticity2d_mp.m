% INPUT:
%
%   spu:      object representing the space of trial functions (see sp_multipatch)
%   spv:      object representing the space of test functions (see sp_multipatch)
%   msh:      object that defines the domain partition and the quadrature rule (see msh_multipatch)
%   E, nu, G: function handles to compute the coefficients
%   patches:  list of patches where the integrals have to be computed. By default, all patches are selected.
%
% OUTPUT:
%
%   mat:    assembled matrix
